# Helsinki City Bike Frontend

## Description

This project is the UI for [HelsinkiCityBike](https://github.com/ValeraPo/HelsinkiCityBike) backend repository. 
On the Home page, you can see some nice pictures generated by the neural network DALL-E. This page will work even without the backend. 
The application also shows Journeys on page “Journeys”. You can upload them in portions of 10 journeys. 
Also, you can see all stations on page “Stations”. There is a pagination, so you cannot see more than 100 stations on one page. 
If you click on any station, it shows you more information about this station. Such as: 
- Station name
- Station address
- Total number of journeys starting from the station
- Total number of journeys ending at the station
- The average distance of a journey starting from the station
- The average distance of a journey ending at the station
- Top 5 most popular return stations for journeys starting from the station
- Top 5 most popular departure stations for journeys ending at the station
